# BioStatsGPT
A learning assistant for bioinformatics and biostatistics topics.

Provides structured and instructive code examples and step-by-step equation and algorithm walkthroughs.

This GPT encourages the user to ask refined, rather than vague, questions, to dive into the deeper aspects of understanding (or misunderstanding).

As with all LLM's, this GPT can and will be wrong. Given this, the GPT will encourage you to spot check and validate it's answers.

The behavior of this GPT is still in development.
